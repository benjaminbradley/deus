Ok so each cue:

a cue
  Mapped cue y/n
  Voting cue
  view
  Stage {whisper, dual, quad}

  options

     Label (what we currently have)
     next cue
     image
     sound (?)

fix data visualization to snap better
change of color oreoborus for whisper votes



So we have voting and non-voting cues.
The Cue Editor is just a nested tree view.
When running the show you have access to watch the nested tree view.

We also have a map, but that's a static graphic and will be based upon the results of each vote. We'll simply attach the cue winner to each one.

Huge question - how do we start a show, and attach all data to a show.

Deus Meeting
3 surfaces with 2 different streams
  voting
  space of the oracle
  smoke video
  multiple screens
  the admin UI needs to have the ability to see god supplicant counts
  copy rob on messages to Moeckler
  swipe credit cards?
    * vote leader board
    * searchbox
  whisper
    *
